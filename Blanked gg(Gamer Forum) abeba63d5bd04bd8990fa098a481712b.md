## Project Concept

A fully fledged forum centered around gamers and gamers only. This would allow for people to post and share different things across the website, while also having private messages and group chats. [Blanked.gg](http://blanked.gg) would also allow for its users to upload images and videos via a hosted media server.

### M1: Initial Setup and Landing Page

The initial setup would be getting the project ready for development. The landing page would consist of a nice complementary color theme that will be carried out through the entire website. The landing page will also be designed to have a very user friendly interface where all the important starting information will be shown to a new user. This information will change eventually based on a users logged in status.
